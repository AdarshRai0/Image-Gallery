- I learned how to handle user interactions such as clicks and keypresses using event listeners, enhancing the interactivity of my web applications.
  
- Mastering the manipulation of the Document Object Model (DOM) allowed me to dynamically change HTML elements, modify styles, and update content, making my applications responsive and engaging.
  
- Asynchronous programming became familiar as I worked with APIs, making asynchronous calls using the `fetch` function. This skill is essential for fetching data without freezing the rest of the code.
  
- I gained expertise in integrating APIs by constructing URLs with parameters, enabling me to request specific data. This knowledge is valuable for creating dynamic, data-driven web applications.
  
- Implementing conditional statements (if-else) empowered me to make decisions in my code based on specific conditions, enhancing the flexibility and functionality of my applications.
  
- I utilized both function declarations and arrow functions, understanding the differences between them and choosing the appropriate one for cleaner and more efficient code.
  
- Managing variables, both globally and locally, allowed me to control the flow of data within my application effectively, ensuring proper organization and structure.
  
- I developed skills in CSS styling, allowing me to create visually appealing and responsive user interfaces, shaping the look and feel of my web projects.
  
- Basic error handling techniques were implemented to handle API call failures gracefully, providing users with appropriate feedback for a seamless experience.
  
- I organized my code into functions, enhancing modularity and readability. This structured approach will prove invaluable as I tackle more complex projects in the future, ensuring maintainability and ease of understanding. 

- This project provided me with a robust foundation in web development, equipping me with essential concepts and skills applicable to real-world projects. I feel more confident in my abilities and am excited to explore further in the world of web development.
